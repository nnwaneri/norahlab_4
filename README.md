Learning Outcomes:

The goal of this lab is to gain experience with stack and queue data structures and their applications.

Part 1:
Use stack or/and queue to implement the is_palindrome() function which takes an input string and returns boolean value true if the input 
string is palindrome, and vice versa. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same 
backward as forward, such as madam or racecar. 
  
Part 2:
Implement an algorithm to evaluate a postfix expression.
